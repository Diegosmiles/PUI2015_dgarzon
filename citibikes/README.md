 We wanted to look at trip durations in a winter month (December 2014) and in a summer month (June 2015), in order to see if there was a statistical significance between the trip durations for the two months. Even though it is cold does that mean that people bike for less time? We asserted in our null hypothesis that their is not difference in the trip durations.

I worked with Alec Mclean on this project. Both of us contributed equally to the project-we both devised the hypothesis, helped at different times writing the code, and both contributed to the analysis of the test.
