The title of the graph is misleading: "Average residential Unit Size Original VERSUS Renovations" 
I think it refers to renovation YEAR but it is not stated on the title, and in the legend there are two type of buildings: New buildings and renovations, so the "year" label may be about something else.

The visualization is good: simple and with not too much information, so I think that a  more clear title and re labeling can make the graphic clear
