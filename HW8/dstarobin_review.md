First of all: the graphic contains a lot of information. This information is more or less clear, but it could have been shown in separated graphs.

The colors are not good separated: for January rides scale of blue was selected and for July the scale of reds was selected, the colors in this scales are very close which make difficult to understand what is happening there.
Also, some events are explained with arrows inside the graph (Holiday, rain, etcetera) and this contribute to the visual saturation of the graph. Finally, in the legend there is only explanation about the color of the dots (which represent average time) and again, this piece of information makes the graphic visually saturated.
