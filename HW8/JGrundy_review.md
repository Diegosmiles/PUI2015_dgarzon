The graphic is clear about what it want to show, and the colors help to visualize the data. 
However, the title and porpose of the graph might be a little confusing. The title said that it's comparing the number of rides
per borough, however in the axis the comparition is done by zipcode. Maybe someone that is not familiar with the graphic could find this a little misleading 
(however, in the explanation of the graphic it's clear enough)

The legend is simple and works, as well as the units.
