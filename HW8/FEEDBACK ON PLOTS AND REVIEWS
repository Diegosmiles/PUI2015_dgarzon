your reviews are fine, though they do not always address the points of color blindness compliance, confusion, honesty. 9.5/10


NOTES YOUR PLOT
=========

color unexplained

size redundant with y position. this rather than clarify the value enforces the concept and leaves a strong impression on the reader, influencing their opinion.

a ticks too small


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED

dstarobin
=========


very nice plot that summarize a lot of details at once

labels in the legend top left too small to read

nice unobtrusive labels showing single events

drop rides from the labels on the right for compactness


consider a more compact notation for the y axis: e.g. use units of 1000 rides


murbaneck
==========
interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant

jgrundy
=======

the plot is clear, colorblind compliant

consider a compressed notation for both axes: riders in units of 10,000 and res housing in units of 10,000 as well.

the line fits are too thin and at the edge of visibility
